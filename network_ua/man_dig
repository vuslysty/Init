DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ddiigg (domain information groper) is a flexible tool for interrogating
       DNS name servers. It performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that
       are returned from the name server(s) that were queried. Most DNS
       administrators use ddiigg to troubleshoot DNS problems because of its
       flexibility, ease of use and clarity of output. Other lookup tools tend
       to have less functionality than ddiigg.

       Although ddiigg is normally used with command-line arguments, it also has
       a batch mode of operation for reading lookup requests from a file. A
       brief summary of its command-line arguments and options is printed when
       the --hh option is given. Unlike earlier versions, the BIND 9
       implementation of ddiigg allows multiple lookups to be issued from the
       command line.

       Unless it is told to query a specific name server, ddiigg will try each of
       the servers listed in _/_e_t_c_/_r_e_s_o_l_v_._c_o_n_f. If no usable server addresses
       are found, ddiigg will send the query to the local host.

       When no command line arguments or options are given, ddiigg will perform
       an NS query for "." (the root).

       It is possible to set per-user defaults for ddiigg via _$_{_H_O_M_E_}_/_._d_i_g_r_c.
       This file is read and any options in it are applied before the command
       line arguments.

       The IN and CH class names overlap with the IN and CH top level domain
       names. Either use the --tt and --cc options to specify the type and class,
       use the --qq the specify the domain name, or use "IN." and "CH." when
       looking up these top level domains.

SSIIMMPPLLEE UUSSAAGGEE
       A typical invocation of ddiigg looks like:

            dig @server name type

       where:

       sseerrvveerr
           is the name or IP address of the name server to query. This can be
           an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in
           colon-delimited notation. When the supplied _s_e_r_v_e_r argument is a
           hostname, ddiigg resolves that name before querying that name server.

           If no _s_e_r_v_e_r argument is provided, ddiigg consults _/_e_t_c_/_r_e_s_o_l_v_._c_o_n_f;
           if an address is found there, it queries the name server at that
           address. If either of the --44 or --66 options are in use, then only
           addresses for the corresponding transport will be tried. If no
           usable addresses are found, ddiigg will send the query to the local
           host. The reply from the name server that responds is displayed.

       nnaammee
           is the name of the resource record that is to be looked up.

       ttyyppee
           indicates what type of query is required -- ANY, A, MX, SIG, etc.
           _t_y_p_e can be any valid query type. If no _t_y_p_e argument is supplied,
           ddiigg will perform a lookup for an A record.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The --bb option sets the source IP address of the query to _a_d_d_r_e_s_s. This
       must be a valid address on one of the host's network interfaces or
       "0.0.0.0" or "::". An optional port may be specified by appending
       "#<port>"

       The default query class (IN for internet) is overridden by the --cc
       option.  _c_l_a_s_s is any valid class, such as HS for Hesiod records or CH
       for Chaosnet records.

       The --ff option makes ddiigg operate in batch mode by reading a list of
       lookup requests to process from the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e. The file contains a
       number of queries, one per line. Each entry in the file should be
       organized in the same way they would be presented as queries to ddiigg
       using the command-line interface.

       The --mm option enables memory usage debugging.

       If a non-standard port number is to be queried, the --pp option is used.
       _p_o_r_t_# is the port number that ddiigg will send its queries instead of the
       standard DNS port number 53. This option would be used to test a name
       server that has been configured to listen for queries on a non-standard
       port number.

       The --44 option forces ddiigg to only use IPv4 query transport. The --66
       option forces ddiigg to only use IPv6 query transport.

       The --tt option sets the query type to _t_y_p_e. It can be any valid query
       type which is supported in BIND 9. The default query type is "A",
       unless the --xx option is supplied to indicate a reverse lookup. A zone
       transfer can be requested by specifying a type of AXFR. When an
       incremental zone transfer (IXFR) is required, _t_y_p_e is set to ixfr=N.
       The incremental zone transfer will contain the changes made to the zone
       since the serial number in the zone's SOA record was _N.

       The --qq option sets the query name to _n_a_m_e. This is useful to
       distinguish the _n_a_m_e from other arguments.

       The --vv causes ddiigg to print the version number and exit.

       Reverse lookups -- mapping addresses to names -- are simplified by the
       --xx option.  _a_d_d_r is an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation, or a
       colon-delimited IPv6 address. When this option is used, there is no
       need to provide the _n_a_m_e, _c_l_a_s_s and _t_y_p_e arguments.  ddiigg automatically
       performs a lookup for a name like 11.12.13.10.in-addr.arpa and sets the
       query type and class to PTR and IN respectively. By default, IPv6
       addresses are looked up using nibble format under the IP6.ARPA domain.
       To use the older RFC1886 method using the IP6.INT domain specify the --ii
       option. Bit string labels (RFC2874) are now experimental and are not
       attempted.

       To sign the DNS queries sent by ddiigg and their responses using
       transaction signatures (TSIG), specify a TSIG key file using the --kk
       option. You can also specify the TSIG key itself on the command line
       using the --yy option; _h_m_a_c is the type of the TSIG, default HMAC-MD5,
       _n_a_m_e is the name of the TSIG key and _k_e_y is the actual key. The key is
       a base-64 encoded string, typically generated by ddnnsssseecc--kkeeyyggeenn(8).
       Caution should be taken when using the --yy option on multi-user systems
       as the key can be visible in the output from ppss(1) or in the shell's
       history file. When using TSIG authentication with ddiigg, the name server
       that is queried needs to know the key and algorithm that is being used.
       In BIND, this is done by providing appropriate kkeeyy and sseerrvveerr
       statements in _n_a_m_e_d_._c_o_n_f.

MMaacc OOSS XX NNOOTTIICCEE
       The ddiigg command does not use the host name and address resolution or
       the DNS query routing mechanisms used by other processes running on Mac
       OS X.  The results of name or address queries printed by ddiigg may differ
       from those found by other processes that use the Mac OS X native name
       and address resolution mechanisms.  The results of DNS queries may also
       differ from queries that use the Mac OS X DNS routing library.

QQUUEERRYY OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       ddiigg provides a number of query options which affect the way in which
       lookups are made and the results displayed. Some of these set or reset
       flag bits in the query header, some determine which sections of the
       answer get printed, and others determine the timeout and retry
       strategies.

       Each query option is identified by a keyword preceded by a plus sign
       (+). Some keywords set or reset an option. These may be preceded by the
       string no to negate the meaning of that keyword. Other keywords assign
       values to options like the timeout interval. They have the form
       ++kkeeyywwoorrdd==vvaalluuee. The query options are:

       ++[[nnoo]]aaaaffllaagg
           A synonym for _+_[_n_o_]_a_a_o_n_l_y.

       ++[[nnoo]]aaaaoonnllyy
           Sets the "aa" flag in the query.

       ++[[nnoo]]aaddddiittiioonnaall
           Display [do not display] the additional section of a reply. The
           default is to display it.

       ++[[nnoo]]aaddffllaagg
           Set [do not set] the AD (authentic data) bit in the query. This
           requests the server to return whether all of the answer and
           authority sections have all been validated as secure according to
           the security policy of the server. AD=1 indicates that all records
           have been validated as secure and the answer is not from a OPT-OUT
           range. AD=0 indicate that some part of the answer was insecure or
           not validated. This bit is set by default.

       ++[[nnoo]]aallll
           Set or clear all display flags.

       ++[[nnoo]]aannsswweerr
           Display [do not display] the answer section of a reply. The default
           is to display it.

       ++[[nnoo]]aauutthhoorriittyy
           Display [do not display] the authority section of a reply. The
           default is to display it.

       ++[[nnoo]]bbeesstteeffffoorrtt
           Attempt to display the contents of messages which are malformed.
           The default is to not display malformed answers.

       ++bbuuffssiizzee==BB
           Set the UDP message buffer size advertised using EDNS0 to _B bytes.
           The maximum and minimum sizes of this buffer are 65535 and 0
           respectively. Values outside this range are rounded up or down
           appropriately. Values other than zero will cause a EDNS query to be
           sent.

       ++[[nnoo]]ccddffllaagg
           Set [do not set] the CD (checking disabled) bit in the query. This
           requests the server to not perform DNSSEC validation of responses.

       ++[[nnoo]]ccll
           Display [do not display] the CLASS when printing the record.

       ++[[nnoo]]ccmmdd
           Toggles the printing of the initial comment in the output
           identifying the version of ddiigg and the query options that have been
           applied. This comment is printed by default.

       ++[[nnoo]]ccoommmmeennttss
           Toggle the display of comment lines in the output. The default is
           to print comments.

       ++[[nnoo]]ddeeffnnaammee
           Deprecated, treated as a synonym for _+_[_n_o_]_s_e_a_r_c_h

       ++[[nnoo]]ddnnsssseecc
           Requests DNSSEC records be sent by setting the DNSSEC OK bit (DO)
           in the OPT record in the additional section of the query.

       ++ddoommaaiinn==ssoommeennaammee
           Set the search list to contain the single domain _s_o_m_e_n_a_m_e, as if
           specified in a ddoommaaiinn directive in _/_e_t_c_/_r_e_s_o_l_v_._c_o_n_f, and enable
           search list processing as if the _+_s_e_a_r_c_h option were given.

       ++[[nnoo]]eeddnnss[[==##]]
           Specify the EDNS version to query with. Valid values are 0 to 255.
           Setting the EDNS version will cause a EDNS query to be sent.
           ++nnooeeddnnss clears the remembered EDNS version. EDNS is set to 0 by
           default.

       ++[[nnoo]]ffaaiill
           Do not try the next server if you receive a SERVFAIL. The default
           is to not try the next server which is the reverse of normal stub
           resolver behavior.

       ++[[nnoo]]iiddeennttiiffyy
           Show [or do not show] the IP address and port number that supplied
           the answer when the _+_s_h_o_r_t option is enabled. If short form answers
           are requested, the default is not to show the source address and
           port number of the server that provided the answer.

       ++[[nnoo]]iiggnnoorree
           Ignore truncation in UDP responses instead of retrying with TCP. By
           default, TCP retries are performed.

       ++[[nnoo]]kkeeeeppooppeenn
           Keep the TCP socket open between queries and reuse it rather than
           creating a new TCP socket for each lookup. The default is
           ++nnookkeeeeppooppeenn.

       ++[[nnoo]]mmuullttiilliinnee
           Print records like the SOA records in a verbose multi-line format
           with human-readable comments. The default is to print each record
           on a single line, to facilitate machine parsing of the ddiigg output.

       ++nnddoottss==DD
           Set the number of dots that have to appear in _n_a_m_e to _D for it to
           be considered absolute. The default value is that defined using the
           ndots statement in _/_e_t_c_/_r_e_s_o_l_v_._c_o_n_f, or 1 if no ndots statement is
           present. Names with fewer dots are interpreted as relative names
           and will be searched for in the domains listed in the sseeaarrcchh or
           ddoommaaiinn directive in _/_e_t_c_/_r_e_s_o_l_v_._c_o_n_f if ++sseeaarrcchh is set.

       ++[[nnoo]]nnssiidd
           Include an EDNS name server ID request when sending a query.

       ++[[nnoo]]nnsssseeaarrcchh
           When this option is set, ddiigg attempts to find the authoritative
           name servers for the zone containing the name being looked up and
           display the SOA record that each name server has for the zone.

       ++[[nnoo]]oonneessooaa
           Print only one (starting) SOA record when performing an AXFR. The
           default is to print both the starting and ending SOA records.

       ++[[nnoo]]qqrr
           Print [do not print] the query as it is sent. By default, the query
           is not printed.

       ++[[nnoo]]qquueessttiioonn
           Print [do not print] the question section of a query when an answer
           is returned. The default is to print the question section as a
           comment.

       ++[[nnoo]]rreeccuurrssee
           Toggle the setting of the RD (recursion desired) bit in the query.
           This bit is set by default, which means ddiigg normally sends
           recursive queries. Recursion is automatically disabled when the
           _+_n_s_s_e_a_r_c_h or _+_t_r_a_c_e query options are used.

       ++rreettrryy==TT
           Sets the number of times to retry UDP queries to server to _T
           instead of the default, 2. Unlike _+_t_r_i_e_s, this does not include the
           initial query.

       ++[[nnoo]]rrrrccoommmmeennttss
           Toggle the display of per-record comments in the output (for
           example, human-readable key information about DNSKEY records). The
           default is not to print record comments unless multiline mode is
           active.

       ++[[nnoo]]sseeaarrcchh
           Use [do not use] the search list defined by the searchlist or
           domain directive in _r_e_s_o_l_v_._c_o_n_f (if any). The search list is not
           used by default.

           'ndots' from _r_e_s_o_l_v_._c_o_n_f (default 1) which may be overridden by
           _+_n_d_o_t_s determines if the name will be treated as relative or not
           and hence whether a search is eventually performed or not.

       ++[[nnoo]]sshhoorrtt
           Provide a terse answer. The default is to print the answer in a
           verbose form.

       ++[[nnoo]]sshhoowwsseeaarrcchh
           Perform [do not perform] a search showing intermediate results.

       ++[[nnoo]]ssiiggcchhaassee
           Chase DNSSEC signature chains. Requires dig be compiled with
           -DDIG_SIGCHASE.

       ++sspplliitt==WW
           Split long hex- or base64-formatted fields in resource records into
           chunks of _W characters (where _W is rounded up to the nearest
           multiple of 4).  _+_n_o_s_p_l_i_t or _+_s_p_l_i_t_=_0 causes fields not to be split
           at all. The default is 56 characters, or 44 characters when
           multiline mode is active.

       ++[[nnoo]]ssttaattss
           This query option toggles the printing of statistics: when the
           query was made, the size of the reply and so on. The default
           behavior is to print the query statistics.

       ++[[nnoo]]ttccpp
           Use [do not use] TCP when querying name servers. The default
           behavior is to use UDP unless an ixfr=N query is requested, in
           which case the default is TCP. AXFR queries always use TCP.

       ++ttiimmee==TT
           Sets the timeout for a query to _T seconds. The default timeout is 5
           seconds. An attempt to set _T to less than 1 will result in a query
           timeout of 1 second being applied.

       ++[[nnoo]]ttooppddoowwnn
           When chasing DNSSEC signature chains perform a top-down validation.
           Requires dig be compiled with -DDIG_SIGCHASE.

       ++[[nnoo]]ttrraaccee
           Toggle tracing of the delegation path from the root name servers
           for the name being looked up. Tracing is disabled by default. When
           tracing is enabled, ddiigg makes iterative queries to resolve the name
           being looked up. It will follow referrals from the root servers,
           showing the answer from each server that was used to resolve the
           lookup.

           ++ddnnsssseecc is also set when +trace is set to better emulate the
           default queries from a nameserver.

       ++ttrriieess==TT
           Sets the number of times to try UDP queries to server to _T instead
           of the default, 3. If _T is less than or equal to zero, the number
           of tries is silently rounded up to 1.

       ++ttrruusstteedd--kkeeyy==########
           Specifies a file containing trusted keys to be used with ++ssiiggcchhaassee.
           Each DNSKEY record must be on its own line.

           If not specified, ddiigg will look for _/_e_t_c_/_t_r_u_s_t_e_d_-_k_e_y_._k_e_y then
           _t_r_u_s_t_e_d_-_k_e_y_._k_e_y in the current directory.

           Requires dig be compiled with -DDIG_SIGCHASE.

       ++[[nnoo]]ttttlliidd
           Display [do not display] the TTL when printing the record.

       ++[[nnoo]]vvcc
           Use [do not use] TCP when querying name servers. This alternate
           syntax to _+_[_n_o_]_t_c_p is provided for backwards compatibility. The
           "vc" stands for "virtual circuit".

MMUULLTTIIPPLLEE QQUUEERRIIEESS
       The BIND 9 implementation of ddiigg supports specifying multiple queries
       on the command line (in addition to supporting the --ff batch file
       option). Each of those queries can be supplied with its own set of
       flags, options and query options.

       In this case, each _q_u_e_r_y argument represent an individual query in the
       command-line syntax described above. Each consists of any of the
       standard options and flags, the name to be looked up, an optional query
       type and class and any query options that should be applied to that
       query.

       A global set of query options, which should be applied to all queries,
       can also be supplied. These global query options must precede the first
       tuple of name, class, type, options, flags, and query options supplied
       on the command line. Any global query options (except the ++[[nnoo]]ccmmdd
       option) can be overridden by a query-specific set of query options. For
       example:

           dig +qr www.isc.org any -x 127.0.0.1 isc.org ns +noqr

       shows how ddiigg could be used from the command line to make three
       lookups: an ANY query for www.isc.org, a reverse lookup of 127.0.0.1
       and a query for the NS records of isc.org. A global query option of _+_q_r
       is applied, so that ddiigg shows the initial query it made for each
       lookup. The final query has a local query option of _+_n_o_q_r which means
       that ddiigg will not print the initial query when it looks up the NS
       records for isc.org.

IIDDNN SSUUPPPPOORRTT
       If ddiigg has been built with IDN (internationalized domain name) support,
       it can accept and display non-ASCII domain names.  ddiigg appropriately
       converts character encoding of domain name before sending a request to
       DNS server or displaying a reply from the server. If you'd like to turn
       off the IDN support for some reason, defines the IIDDNN__DDIISSAABBLLEE
       environment variable. The IDN support is disabled if the variable is
       set when ddiigg runs.
