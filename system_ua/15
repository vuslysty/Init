# Exercise 15
# Find the command that kills the background commandâ€™s process

kill -9 `jobs -p` #    - kill all  (sends SIGKILL signals to all of them)

#  Alternative:
# disown               - kill last processes
# kill %[job_id]       - kill process by its job id
# kill PID             - kill process by its PID
# pkill [name_pattern] - kill process by its name pattern
